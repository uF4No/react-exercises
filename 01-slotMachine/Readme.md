# Slot machine
Basic app to understand how to create React apps without using create-react-app CLI. 
React base, dependencies (react-dom, babel), and all components are imported as scripts in index.html.

The machine component renders a random selection of 3 emojis and, if all are equal displays a 'You win!' message.
