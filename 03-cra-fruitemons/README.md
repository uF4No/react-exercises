# Fruitemons Card game
Based on a list of cards, shufle them to create two Decks (component). 
Each Deck will render all its Cards (component) and the Deck with more total experience (sum of all xp points of the cards) will win. 

## Lessons learned
* Pass properties to child components
* Loop over a list to render multiple instances of the same component with map()
* Conditional rendering using the ternary operator

### Bonus
* Generate a random numbers to shuffle all cards
* Array.reduce() to calculate the total xp of each deck
* Some flexbox
